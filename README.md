# RockPaperScissorsConsole
A simple rock paper scissors console game.

If you are not familiar with this game you can check out the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors).

## Input and output
We take the player's move from the console as follows:
* Rock or r
* Paper or p
* Scissors or s

Then we generate a random move for the computer and reveal the game state.

## Solution
To figure out our game state we use checks to see who won or if it was a draw as in the table bellow.

For the play again feature we use a while loop with a check.
To keep the score we use a simple counter that we increment when we determine the game state.
